# Item Price Data scraper for Old School Runescape

This script scrapes the official OSRS GE data and organizes it by date, item name, and price. It inserts all of this data into a CSV file of your choice.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 (pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup)
  
CSV Editor (I used excel)

### Installing

Just place the script into the same folder as your CSV file and then replace 'YOUR.csv' in the script with your csv's file name.
